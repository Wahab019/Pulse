                      As far as followership goes, there is no doubt that
                      football occupies an exalted position on the African
                      continent.
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      The sport, popular around the world for its low barrier of
                      entry, captures the attention and imagination of the
                      African youth most keenly, and is an unmistakable outlet
                      for passion and emotion.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This clearly informed TikTok’s partnership with the
                      Confederation of African Football (CAF), a move that,
                      according to the short-form video hosting app, is geared
                      toward “bring[ing] unmissable football content to fans,
                      both on the continent and across the globe.” It is&nbsp;
                      not only the first of its kind within the context of the
                      sport in Africa, but it is also TikTok’s first major brand
                      partnership on the continent – a clear statement of
                      intent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The agreement between CAF and TikTok was announced in
                      early 2022, in time for the kick-off of the 2021 Africa
                      Cup of Nations in Cameroon. While the timing was
                      opportune, it was by no means a one-off; fans all over the
                      continent were able to engage and create content around
                      the 2022 CAF Champions League. TikTok is also poised to be
                      a key player during the 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations
                      in Morocco, which kicks off on July 2, 2022. In partnering
                      with CAF, TikTok has made it possible for&nbsp; fans to
                      communally share moments of triumph and history through
                      highlights and matchday content right on the app. This not
                      only makes the platform a destination in itself, but also
                      captures the excitement and passion of these major
                      sporting events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Unsurprisingly, football content on the platform is hugely
                      popular and well-received, with a number of creators
                      taking advantage of the cool filters, in-app effects and
                      trendy challenges to reach out to wide audiences in the
                      tens of thousands.

                      Sports radio presenter Aderonke Adesola (olorisports1) has
                      accrued a significant following through the unique use of
                      subtle wordplay in the Yoruba language.

                      For Ekpolo Simon Ogheneruona (youngnoblecommentary), it is
                      his uncanny mimicry of popular football commentary that
                      has endeared him to an audience of over 250,000
                      followers.&nbsp;

                      news and occasionally weighs in on controversial talking
                      points, while Binutu Timilehin Moses (been_timz) presents
                      interesting stats and facts over catchy music while
                      staring into the distance and striking a pose.

                    <p>
                      These creators have all found fertile ground for their
                      varying content on TikTok, fulfilling the platform’s
                      desire to become “a home for the spirit and passion of
                      iconic sporting events”, while at the same time driving
                      conversation and demonstrating their passion in a manner
                      that is authentically African. It is precisely this
                      diversity of expression that informed TikTok’s desire to
                      partner with CAF.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As Content Operations Manager for Africa, Boniswa Sidwaba
                      put it, there is a “lot of potential to harness and
                      cultivate creative football expression on our platform.”
                      The sense, then, is that this is only just scratching the
                      surface of what creators can accomplish using the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While this push aims to cement and grow the TikTok brand
                      within Africa’s sporting context, the platform is also
                      mindful of the potentially harmful effects of toxic
                      fandom. The use of social media to spread hate and
                      discrimination against certain demographics is not
                      uncommon, and it has never been more important for
                      platforms to intervene in order to protect the rights and
                      mental health of frequently targeted minorities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In line with this, TikTok has put safety protocols in
                      place, with its #SwipeOutHate campaign aiming to forestall
                      the proliferation of harmful content on its platform. Its
                      stance against hate is unequivocal, as is the desire to
                      evolve its security measures and guidelines to meet
                      increasingly complex challenges. This manifests itself in
                      the pursuit of continuous education, academic consultation
                      and the deployment of technology to identify and weed out
                      unwholesome content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      TikTok’s inbuilt safety tools – the restriction of direct
                      messages, moderation of comments, and confidential
                      reporting, to name a few – are not only means by which
                      hate can be combatted, but also ensure that creators
                      remain in control of their own individual spaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With safety as top priority, TikTok is leaving no stone
                      unturned in creating a veritable hub for African football,
                      and is opening up new digital frontiers for the growth and
                      development of the sport on the continent.
