              <p>
                This privacy policy relates to all ‘Pulse Africa’ (from here on
                Pulse) services: we are a new media publisher and platform for
                contributors in Africa that reaches a lot of people, so we are
                specifically conscious about this topic. Bear with us on this
                long text – it is for your benefit and is applicable to the
                different countries of operation. Let us know if you have any
                questions!
              </p>

              <p>
                Pulse and its partnered license brands know that you care about
                how your personal information is used and shared, and we take
                your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn
                more about our privacy policy. By visiting our website, you are
                accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. It
                additionally covers our newsletter and other touch points with
                our platform – unless they are covered directly by privacy
                policies of third-party-providers.
              </p>

              <p>
                This Privacy Policy covers Pulse’s treatment of personal
                information that Pulse gathers when you are on the Pulse website
                and when you use any Pulse services. This policy does not apply
                to the practices of third parties that Pulse does not own or
                control, or to individuals that Pulse does not employ or manage.

              <p style="font-weight: 700">Information Collected by Pulse</p>

              <p>
                We only collect personal information that is relevant to the
                purpose of our website. This information allows us to provide
                you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not
                process this information in a way that is incompatible with this
                objective. We collect the following types of information from
                our Pulse users:
              </p>

              <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700"
                  >1. Information You Provide to Us:</span
                >
                We receive and store any information you enter on our website or
                provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us
                with certain information, but then you may not be able to take
                advantage of special features.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700">2. Automatic Information:</span>
              </p>

              <p>
                We receive and store certain types of information whenever you
                interact with us. Pulse and its authorized agents automatically
                receive and record certain traffic data on their server logs
                from your browser including your IP address, Pulse cookie
                information, and the page you requested. Pulse uses this traffic
                data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends
                and administer the website.
              </p>

              <p>
                Pulse may collect and, on any page, display the total counts
                that page has been viewed.
              </p>

              <p>
                Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites
                anonymously. While Pulse will not be able to provide you with a
                personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you
                to be aware that these programs are available.
              </p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: 700">E-mail Communications</span></p>

              <p>
                Pulse is very concerned about your privacy and we will never
                provide your email address to a third party without your
                explicit permission, as detailed in the Sharing Your Information
                section below. Pulse may send out e-mails with Pulse -related
                news, products, offers, surveys or promotions.
              </p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: 700">Cookies</span></p>

              <p>
                Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your
                computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
                systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages
                in our website are visited and by how many people. Pulse cookies
                do not collect personal information, and we do not combine
                information collected through cookies with other personal
                information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or
                e-mail address is.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Help portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will
                direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new
                cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive
                a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that
                you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use
                some of our coolest features.
              </p>

              <p>
                Pulse’s advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser
                that make it possible to collect anonymous non-personally
                identifiable information that ad delivery systems use to present
                more relevant ads.

              <p>
                Rest assured that we neither rent nor sell your personal

              <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700">Pulse’s Personnel:</span> Pulse’s
                personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have

              <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 700">Business Transfers:</span> In
                some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types
                of transactions, user information is typically one of the
                business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Pulse’s, or
                substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information
                would be one of the assets that is transferred.

                We may release personal information when we believe in good
                faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce
                or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the
                rights, property, or safety of Pulse, our employees, our users,
                or others. This includes exchanging information with other
                companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
                reduction.

                <span style="font-weight: 700">With Your Consent:</span> Except
                as noted above, we will contact you when your personal
                information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose
                incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally
